placeholderIP.xml is the most recent version of the tsung testing that we have been using. The arrival phases may be changed to test different servers, but this will serve as a template with respect to critical path of the testing
placeholderIP.xml is also the only script currently usable with tsung_run.shbecause of the placeholderIP string in the server IP.
